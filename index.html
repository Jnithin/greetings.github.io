        Hey! I am <strong>JOHN NITHIN</strong>. I'am here to tell you about <strong>CHIRSTMAS</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Christmas is not about Santa Clause, not about decorations, not about sweets.., It's about how <strong>JESUS</strong> came to be born once. and died on the cross for our sin. The name <strong>CHIRSTMAS</strong> comes from the Mass of Christ. Christmas
        is about showing the love of christ to others. Christmas is about totally pure, unconditional, irrepressible, inconceivably awesome, self-denying <strong>TRUE</strong> love of christ.
